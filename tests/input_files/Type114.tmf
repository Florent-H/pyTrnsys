Type114 models a single (constant) speed pump that is able to maintain a constant fluid outlet mass flow rate. Pump starting and stopping characteristics are not modeled, nor are pressure drop effects. As with most pumps
and fans in TRNSYS, Type114 takes mass flow rate as an input but ignores the value except in order to perform mass balance checks. Type114 sets the downstream flow rate based on its rated flow rate parameter and the current value of its control signal input.

Motor heat loss fraction
SN
1
The fraction of the motor heat loss transferred to the fluid stream.  The motor heat loss is calculated by subtracting the efficiency of the motor from 1 and multiplying the resultant quantity by the power consumption.  Typical values for this parameter are 0 for motors mounted outside the fluid stream and 1 for motors mounted within the fluid stream.

Overall pump efficiency
SN
1
The overall efficiency of the pump.  The overall pump efficiency includes the inefficiencies due to the motor and shaft friction.  The overall pump efficiency must be less than the motor efficiency.  The lower the efficiency the greater the amount of power consumed and the greater the heat transfer to the fluid and/or ambient.
